                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Railways were introduced in India in 1853 and as their development progressed through to the
                    twentieth
                    century, several company managed and systems grew up. To enforce standardization and co-ordination
                    amongst various railway systems, the Indian Railway Conference Association (IRCA) was set up in
                    1903,
                    followed by the Central Standards Office (CSO) was set up at Shimla in 1930, for preparation of
                    designs,
                    standards and specifications. However, till independence, most of the designs and manufacture of
                    railway
                    equipments was entrusted to foreign consultants. With Independence and the resultant phenomenal
                    increase
                    in country&rsquo;s industrial and economic activity, which increased the demand of rail
                    transportation -
                    a new organisation called Railway Testing and Research Centre (RTRC) was setup&nbsp;in 1952 at
                    Lucknow,
                    for testing and conducting applied research for&nbsp;development of railway rolling stock, permanent
                    way
                    etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Central Standards Office (CSO) and the Railway Testing and Research Centre (RTRC) were integrated
                    into a
                    single unit named Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO) in 1957, under Ministry of
                    Railways
                    at Lucknow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The status of RDSO has been changed from an ’Attached Office’ to ’Zonal Railway’ since 01.01.2003.
